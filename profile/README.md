# 👋 Hey, we’re QuaBot!
> Building tools for developers and communities — and bringing QuaBot back, better than ever.

We’re officially back online — rebuilt, redesigned, and ready for the next chapter.
After months of work and a full restructuring of our infrastructure, projects, and branding, QuaBot is once again operational.
But we’re not stopping there: we’re building a full suite of tools for developers and communities:
- QuaBot v8 → The next generation of the QuaBot Discord Bot, previously trusted by over **120,000 users across 1,500 servers**. More stable, more powerful, and full of new features. Try it now at [quabot.net](https://quabot.net).
- Pasterboard → A cleaner, more user-friendly way to share your thoughts with friends, with built-in replies and messaging that is in early development.
- SnipVault → Organize, store, and reuse your code snippets without digging through endless files.
- QuaPin → Our upcoming task tracker, designed to be simple, effective, and team-friendly.

We’re back, rebuilding everything — projects, tools, and branding — from the ground up. Stay tuned: **2026 will be our biggest year yet**.
