## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m QuaBot!
QuaBot is returning to the scene in 2026, with our latest and best version of QuaBot yet! We are working on various projects and can't wait to share them with you:
- QuaBot v8: the same QuaBot 120.000 people knew and loved, but better. Stable. New features. Coming in 2026.
- Pasterboard: updated to be even more user friendly.
- SnipVault: manage your code snippets and sort them, reuse them without digging through hundreds of files.
- QuaPin: our own task tracker that is in the design phase and we can't wait to work on more.

QuaBot has been offline for the last few months, and we are currently working on getting all our projects and branding back online.
