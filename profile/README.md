# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, weâ€™re QuaBot!
> Building tools for developers and communities â€” and bringing QuaBot back, better than ever.

Weâ€™re bringing QuaBot back in 2026 â€” **better, faster**, and **packed** with new features.
But weâ€™re not stopping there: weâ€™re building a full suite of tools for developers and communities:
- QuaBot v8 â†’ The next generation of the QuaBot Discord Bot, previously trusted by over **120,000 users across 1,500 servers**. More stable, more powerful, and full of new features. Currently in mid-stage development.
- Pasterboard â†’ A cleaner, more user-friendly way to share your thoughts with friends, with built-in replies and messaging that is in early development.
- SnipVault â†’ Organize, store, and reuse your code snippets without digging through endless files.
- QuaPin â†’ Our upcoming task tracker, designed to be simple, effective, and team-friendly.

For 2.5 years, we were consistently shipping projects, building tools, and growing our community. These last few months weâ€™ve been offline due to circumstances, but we are back better than ever.

Weâ€™re now fully back, rebuilding everything â€” projects, tools, and branding â€” from the ground up. Stay tuned: **2026 will be our biggest launch yet**.
